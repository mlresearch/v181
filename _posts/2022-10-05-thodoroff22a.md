title: Benchmarking Real-Time Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Decision-making algorithms can require fast response time in applications
  as diverse as self-driving cars and minimizing load times of webpages. Yet, modern
  algorithms (deep reinforcement learning) are usually developed in  scenarios where
  inference and training computational costs are ignored. This proposal aims to study
  reinforcement learning and control algorithms for real-time continuous control.
  In this scenario, the environment continuously evolves  while actions are being
  computed by the agent (either in training or inference).  The first goal is to provide
  a clear picture of the performance of modern algorithms modulated by their computational
  costs. The second goal is to identify the major challenges that arise when considering
  real-time environments to guide further research.
