title: Elevating Perceptual Sample Quality in PCs through Differentiable Sampling
abstract: Deep generative models have seen a dramatic improvement in recent years,
  due to the use of alternative losses based on perceptual assessment of generated
  samples. This improvement has not yet been applied to the model class of probabilistic
  circuits (PCs), presumably due to significant technical challenges concerning differentiable
  sampling, which is a key requirement for optimizing perceptual losses. This is unfortunate,
  since PCs allow a much wider range of probabilistic inference routines than main-stream
  generative models, such as exact and efficient marginalization and conditioning.
  Motivated by the success of loss reframing in deep generative models, we incorporate
  perceptual metrics into the PC learning objective. To this aim, we introduce a differentiable
  sampling procedure for PCs, where the central challenge is the non-differentiability
  of sampling from the categorical distribution over latent PC variables. We take
  advantage of the Gumbel-Softmax trick and develop a novel inference pass to smoothly
  interpolate child samples as a strategy to circumvent non-differentiability of sum
  node sampling. We initially hypothesized, that perceptual losses, unlocked by our
  novel differentiable sampling procedure, will elevate the generative power of PCs
  and improve their sample quality to be on par with neural counterparts like probabilistic
  auto-encoders and generative adversarial networks. Although our experimental findings
  empirically reject this hypothesis for now, the results demonstrate that samples
  drawn from PCs optimized with perceptual losses can have similar sample quality
  compared to likelihood-based optimized PCs and, at the same time, can express richer
  contrast, colors, and details. Whereas before, PCs were restricted to likelihood-based
  optimization, this work has paved the way to advance PCs with loss formulations
  that have been built around deep neural networks in recent years.
